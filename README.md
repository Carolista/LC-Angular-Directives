# LC-Angular-Directives

This example gives you practice on using the Angular structural directives \*ngIf and \*ngFor. Bonus feature: you get to see all the delicious southern food my grandmother used to make.

**IMPORTANT - read the instructions.txt file before you begin.**

Students - FORK this to your own account and then clone down to your local machine. There is a **starter-code** branch and a **solution** branch for reference if you get really stuck.

Initially when you open the project in VSCode on your local computer, you will be in the main/master branch. Use the command 'git branch' in the terminal to view all available branches as shown below:

Then use 'git checkout starter-code' to switch to the starter-code branch:

If you wish to reference the solution, you can switch to that branch anytime as well.
